# Memory Game for Sociable Platform | Jobfair (2014-2015)
Introduction
------------
This repository contains an interactive memory Game, implemented during participation in a software contest in Jobfair Athens 2014-2015. This memory game was part of *Sociable*, a bigger platform developed by the European Research Program as a new approach for assisted cognitive training and social activation for older adults with Mild Cognitive Impairment, as well as patients suffering from mild Alzheimer's disease. You can find more about the project [here](http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/apps/projects/factsheet/index.cfm?project_ref=238891) and in the [official site](http://www.cognitivetraining.eu/).

Requirements
-------------
- The game is comprised of a palette with 4 different colors
- Each time a random sequence of colors is shown to the user
- The user has to remember the sequence and select the colors in the same sequence
- Each time the user succeeds, he gets to the next level, where the sequence grows by 1
- The maximum level is 50
- In each game, the sequence is different

Technologies
---------------
The game had to be implemented using only HTML, CSS and Javascript (jQuery allowed), or the [Construct2 platform](https://www.scirra.com/construct2). This specific implementation was completed using HTML, CSS and Javascript. jQuery and media queries were used, so that the game is also responsive and functional in mobiles and tablets.
